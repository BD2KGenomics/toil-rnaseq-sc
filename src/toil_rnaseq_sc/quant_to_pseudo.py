    Convert output of kallisto_sc_quant docker image (individual abundance.tsv's for each cell)
        to the same output format as kallisto pseudo (ec, cells, tsv) as described here:
            https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kallisto-sleuth-users/PRTG9yPVBzg
    In the converted output, the ec file is one-to-one since each 'equivalence class' is in fact a transcript.
    The transcript numbers are based on the order of transcripts in the abundance.tsv's and are one-indexed.
    The one-indexing means that it is possible to access transcripts directly without removing the header of an abundance tsv.
    It is assumed that all the abundance.tsv's used the same index and have the same transcripts in the same order.
    The actual transcript names are not exported; use any of the original abundance.tsv's to obtain the transcript names.
